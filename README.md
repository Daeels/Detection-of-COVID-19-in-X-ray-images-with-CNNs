# Detection of COVID-19 in X-ray Images with CNNs 🦠📷🧑‍💻

Welcome to the Detection of COVID-19 in X-ray Images with CNNs project! This is a deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect COVID-19 in X-ray images.

## Overview 📝

This project aims to detect COVID-19 in X-ray images using deep learning techniques. It uses a dataset of X-ray images of patients with COVID-19, as well as X-ray images of patients with other respiratory diseases and healthy patients. 

Attached The dataset used :  [COVID-19 Image Data](https://github.com/Daeels/Detection-of-COVID-19-in-X-ray-images-with-CNNs/tree/main/dataset).
